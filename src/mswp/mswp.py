def clear(func):
    """
    A decorator that cleans up temporary local variables used within a function after its execution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : function
        The function to be decorated.

    Returns
    -------
    function
        The decorated function.

    Notes
    -----
    This decorator ensures that temporary local variables within the decorated function are cleared after its execution, 
    preventing clutter and potential memory leaks.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> @cleanup_locals
    ... def my_function():
    ...     temp_var = 10
    ...     # Your code here
    ...     return result

    In this example, `my_function` is decorated with `cleanup_locals`, ensuring that any temporary local variables 
    used within it are cleared upon completion.

    @functools.wraps(func)

        """
        Executes the function, cleans up temporary local variables, and returns the result.

        Parameters
        ----------
        *args : list
            Positional arguments to be passed to the function.
            
        **kwargs : dict
            Keyword arguments to be passed to the function.

        Returns
        -------

            The result of the function execution.
