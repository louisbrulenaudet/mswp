Tidy is a Python decorator designed to enhance code cleanliness and mitigate potential memory leaks by automatically clearing temporary local variables after function execution.

## Overview

Python functions often create temporary variables for intermediate computations, which can clutter the local namespace and potentially lead to memory leaks if not properly managed. Tidy addresses this issue by providing a simple yet powerful decorator that automatically cleans up temporary local variables, ensuring a tidy and efficient execution environment.

## Installation
You can install Tidy via pip:

```bash
pip3 install tidy
```
## Usage
  
To use Tidy, simply decorate your functions with @tidy. This ensures that any temporary local variables used within the function are cleared upon completion, promoting code cleanliness and efficient memory usage.

```python
from tidy import tidy

@tidy
def my_function():
	temp_var = 10
	# Your code here
	return result
```
In this example, my_function is decorated with @tidy, ensuring that any temporary local variables used within it are cleared upon completion.

### Parameters
`func`: The function to be decorated.

### Returns
`function`: The decorated function.

## Features
- Automatic Cleanup: Tidy automatically clears temporary local variables after function execution, preventing clutter and potential memory leaks.

- Simplified Syntax: With a simple decorator, Tidy streamlines code maintenance and promotes readability.

- Error Handling: Tidy provides robust error handling to ensure reliable execution even in the presence of exceptions.
